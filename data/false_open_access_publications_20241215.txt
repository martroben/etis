During the calibration a relation between the pixels in 3D laser scanner camera image and the real world units is made. Laser line detection method as part of the calibration process plays an important role in this calibration process, but this aspect has not been investigated before. In this paper the calibration and measurement result dependency from the laser line detection with pixel or sub-pixel resolution in the calibration process has been investigated. The calibration process of the developed 3D laser scanner has been described. The results show dependency between the laser line detection method in the calibration process and the final measurement results.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.eee.21.6.13765",

        "abstract": "Wireless body area networks (WBANs) have revolutionized healthcare by enabling remote supervision, prior detection, and disease interception using invasive and wearable sensor devices. The limited battery capacity of the sensors coupled with the poor channel condition (that may arise from body postures) require cooperative transmission strategies that can prolong the sensors' life time and associated functionalities. Therefore, in this article, a cooperative scheme based on single-stage relaying is presented for spectrum and energy efficiency. The relay operating for two different scenarios, i.e. network coding and hierarchical modulation, is discussed. The general trend for bit error rate (BER) is observed by modeling a Rayleigh faded link catering path loss. The results are further studied for actual channel models, defined in WBAN standard. The effect of hop-length variation on BER and packet error rate (PER) are discussed. Simulation results show that both cooperative schemes outperform direct communication. A hybrid switching scheme is proposed to enhance efficiency.",

In particular, droplet microflow cytometry (DMFC) enables the analysis of cells reacting to different stimuli in chemical isolation due to each droplet acting as an isolated microreactor. Furthermore, at high flow rates, the droplets allow massive parallelization, further increasing the throughput of droplets. However, this novel methodology poses unique challenges related to commonly used fluorometry and fluorescent microscopy techniques. We review the optical sensor technology and light sources applicable to DMFC, as well as analyze the challenges and advantages of each option, primarily focusing on electronics. An analysis of low-cost and/or sufficiently compact systems that can be incorporated into portable devices is also presented.",

        "abstract": "Integration of the Cyber\u2013Physical System (CPS) concept with bio-analytical devices is highly desirable to enable device automation as well as to improve diagnostic and analytical capabilities. However, the modeling must account for entity interactions, system dynamics, and non-functional aspects required for proper device functionality. This paper presents a model-based system architecture that builds upon an extended timed automata-based formal technique. In contrast to prior works that utilized SysML or UML-based models, this allows for the wireless control of bio-analytical instruments. Using this formal method, the UPPAAL tool is used to model and test a case study called \u201cA droplet flow cytometer for testing bacteria\u2019s susceptibility to antibiotics\u201d. The study shows the implications of formal techniques for the design and verification of wireless automation of high-throughput laboratory setups in Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE). Moreover, the paper extends the above aspects by adding the possibility to model multi-system interaction. This is used to analyze the trade-off between centralized and decentralized information flow strategies for better system performance under delay and bandwidth constraints. UPPAAL Stratego is used to analyze strategies for achieving specific delays and bandwidth consumption while avoiding packet losses in the event of network congestion. The results show that under strict delay constraints and high traffic, the use-case system selects the decentralized strategy over the centralized strategy. In low-traffic scenarios, the centralized strategy is more effective at ensuring the reliable operation of systems.",

        "abstract": "Wolfram syndrome (WS), caused by mutations in WFS1 gene, is a multi-targeting disease affecting multiple organ systems. Wolframin is localized in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), influencing Ca2+ metabolism and ER interaction with mitochondria, but the exact role of the protein remains unclear. In this study we aimed to characterize alterations in energy metabolism in the cardiac and in the oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscles in Wfs1-deficiency.Alterations in the bioenergetic profiles in the cardiac and skeletal muscles of Wfs1-knock-out (KO) male mice and their wild type male littermates were determined using high resolution respirometry, quantitative RT-PCR, NMR spectroscopy, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy.Oxygen consumption without ATP synthase activation (leak) was significantly higher in the glycolytic muscles of Wfs1 KO mice compared to wild types. ADP-stimulated respiration with glutamate and malate was reduced in the Wfs1-deficient cardiac as well as oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscles.Wfs1-deficiency in both cardiac and skeletal muscles results in functional alterations of energy transport from mitochondria to ATP-ases. There was a substrate-dependent decrease in the maximal Complex I -linked respiratory capacity of the electron transport system in muscles of Wfs1 KO mice. Moreover, in cardiac and gastrocnemius white muscles a decrease in the function of one pathway were balanced by the increase in the activity of the parallel pathway.This work provides new insights to the muscle involvement at early stages of metabolic syndrome like WS as well as developing glucose intolerance.",

        "abstract": "A study was carried out to assess if the visual soil assessment method (VSA) would allow recognizing differences between soils receiving organic matter (OM) amendments and similar control soils, by the observation of visual soil quality indicators' score. 36 practices were identified across 8 pedoclimatic zones. These fields/plots were paired with nearby control fields/plots, without OM amendments, sharing similar farming features. A survey, comprising a VSA of the soil structure status, surface ponding, signs of erosion, earthworm counts and soil stability (slake test), complemented by measurements of soil organic matter (SOM) and permanganate oxidizable organic carbon (LOC) content, soil pH, penetration resistance and texture, on soils of both management system groups (OM addition and Control), was performed in 2016. Correlations of the visual soil quality indicators' score with SOM, LOC, other soil properties and climate variables and indices were calculated within each group; the correlations between soil properties, and between soil properties (SOM and LOC) and climate variables were also calculated. A statistically significantly higher proportion of soils of the OM group had a good score for \"soil structure and consistency\" and \"soil porosity\". These differences are not directly explained by non-inherent soil properties. No statistically significant Spearman's correlation coefficients were observed between \"soil structure and consistency\" and either soil properties or climate variables; concerning \"soil porosity\", distinct statistically significant correlations were observed between the two groups with different climate variables and indices. Correlations between the scores of the visual soil quality indicators and climate variables were found to follow the same directions of correlations of LOC content with the same climate variables, although the latter correlations were weak. Mean SOM and LOC content, were slightly higher in the OM group, although differences were not statistically significant. A high linear correlation between LOC (mg/g) and SOM (%) (r = 0.65, n = 26) exists within the Control group, but not within the OM group (r = 0.20 and n = 26). When the relationship of SOM and LOC content with visual soil quality indicators' score was studied, statistically significant correlations were only observed between SOM and \"earthworm count\" within the Control group (rs = 0.44), and between LOC and \"soil colour\" within the OM group (rs=-0.52). Both LOC content and LOC status (ranked as a function of LOC content and soil texture), had only negative statistically significant correlations with visual soil quality indicators' score, questioning their worth as stand-alone soil quality indicators.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates 11 agricultural management practices (AMPs) and their effects on seven visual soil quality indicators and soil aggregate stability. The survey carried out across eight pedoclimatic zones in Europe and China was based on visual soil assessments (New Zealand VSA method) performed on soils subject to different soil management practices and nearby similar soils, under similar farming features, without the distinctive soil management practice (control). Fisher's exact test was used to test if the management treatment was independent of the score of each visual soil quality indicator and to test if the management treatment produced a higher frequency of the score \u2018good\u2019. The results showed a statistically significant (\u03b1 &lt; .05) higher frequency of the score \u2018good\u2019 for \u2018soil structure and consistency\u2019 and/or \u2018soil porosity\u2019 for six AMPs. For no\u2010till AMP, the null hypothesis can also be rejected for \u2018susceptibility to erosion\u2019 and \u2018soil stability\u2019 and for \u2018mulching + permanent soil cover\u2019 AMP, for the \u2018presence of tillage pan\u2019 and \u2018soil colour\u2019. The hypothesis that the management treatment was independent of the score of each indicator was rejected for \u2018soil structure and consistency\u2019 of three AMPs, for \u2018soil porosity\u2019 of three AMPs, for \u2018soil colour\u2019 of one AMP and for the \u2018presence of tillage pan\u2019 of one AMP. This study demonstrates that farming systems sharing a common influential soil management practice at different locations and with different soil types significantly affect the score of some visual soil quality indicators.",

        "abstract": "Soil erosion caused by climate and land-use changes is one of the biggest environmental challenges in highland Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess the future soil erosion risks and evaluate the potential conservation measures in the Rib watershed, northwestern highland Ethiopia. We used the HadGEM2-ES model with a moderate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration scenario (RCP4.5) to project the future climate. The future land-use patterns were predicted using the CA-Markov model. We integrated the RUSLE model with GIS to estimate the spatial distribution of soil loss and identify erosion risk areas. We found that the Rib watershed is highly vulnerable to future climate and land-use changes, leading to a high soil erosion risk. Despite slight growth of forest cover during the study period, the total soil loss for the watershed was estimated to be 7.93 \u00d7 106 t year\u22121 in 2017 and was predicted to increase to 9.75 \u00d7 106 t year\u22121 in 2050, an increase of about 23%. The increase in forest cover was due to the expansion of the area of eucalyptus plantations which are more prone to erosion. Moreover, field survey showed that the residual native forests are sparsely vegetated and mostly used for cattle grazing, increasing the erosion risk even more. In contrast, the combined use of afforestation with native trees and physical soil conservation measures in the upper areas of the catchment could decrease soil loss by 62%. Our results stress the importance of combining soil conservation measures, including converting eucalyptus plantations to native forests, to mitigate the effects of future climate change and increased agricultural production on soil erosion.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Monitoring vessel traffic in coastal regions is a key element of maritime security. For this reason, additional ways of detecting moving vessels are explored by using the unique structure of their wake waves based on pressure measurements at the seabed. The experiments are performed at a distance of about 2 km from the sailing line using novel multisensor devices called \u201chydromasts\u201d that track both pressure and near-bed water flow current velocities. The main tool for the analysis is a windowed Fourier transform that produces a spectrogram of the wake structure. It is shown that time series from the pressure sensors, measured at a frequency of 100 Hz, 0.2 m above the seabed are a valid source of input data for the spectrogram technique. This technique portrays the properties of both divergent and transverse waves with an accuracy and resolution that is sufficient for the evaluation of the speed and distance of the detected vessels from the measurement device. All the detected passings are matched with vessels using automatic identification system (AIS) data. The use of several time series from synchronized multisensor systems substantially suppresses noise and improves the quality of the outcome compared to one-point measurements. Additional information about variations in the water flow in wakes provides a simple and reasonably accurate tool for rapid detection of ship passages.",

        "abstract": "The Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) phenomenon is agreed to be one of the main reliability concerns in nanoscale circuits. It increases the threshold voltage of pMOS transistors, thus, slows down signal propagation along logic paths between flip-flops. NBTI may cause intermittent faults and, ultimately, the circuit's permanent functional failures. In this paper, we propose an innovative NBTI mitigation approach by rejuvenating the nanoscale logic along NBTI-critical paths. The method is based on hierarchical identification of NBTI-critical paths and the generation of rejuvenation stimuli using an Evolutionary Algorithm. A new, fast, yet accurate model for computation of NBTI-induced delays at gate-level is developed. This model is based on intensive SPICE simulations of individual gates. The generated rejuvenation stimuli are used to drive those pMOS transistors to the recovery phase, which are the most critical for the NBTI-induced path delay. It is intended to apply the rejuvenation procedure to the circuit, as an execution overhead, periodically. Experimental results performed on a set of designs demonstrate reduction of NBTI-induced delays by up to two times with an execution overhead of 0.1 % or less. The proposed approach is aimed at extending the reliable lifetime of nanoelectronics.",

        "abstract": "Feedback between plants and soil microbial communities can be a powerful driver of vegetation dynamics. Plants elicit changes in the soil microbiome that either promote or suppress conspecifics at the same location, thereby regulating population density-dependence and species co-existence. Such effects are often attributed to the accumulation of host-specific antagonistic or beneficial microbiota in the rhizosphere. However, the identity and host-specificity of the microbial taxa involved are rarely empirically assessed. Here we review the evidence for host-specificity in plant-associated microbes and propose that specific plant-soil feedbacks can also be driven by generalists. We outline the potential mechanisms by which generalist microbial pathogens, mutualists and decomposers can generate differential effects on plant hosts and synthesize existing evidence to predict these effects as a function of plant investments into defence, microbial mutualists and dispersal. Importantly, the capacity of generalist microbiota to drive plant-soil feedbacks depends not only on the traits of individual plants but also on the phylogenetic and functional diversity of plant communities. Identifying factors that promote specialization or generalism in plant-microbial interactions and thereby modulate the impact of microbiota on plant performance will advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant-soil feedback and the ways it contributes to plant co-existence.",

Here, we provide a conceptual framework for the role of drought in PSF, considering plant traits, drought severity, and historical precipitation over ecological and evolutionary timescales. Comparing experimental studies where plants and microbes do or do not share a drought history (through co-sourcing or conditioning), we hypothesise that plants and microbes with a shared drought history experience more positive PSF under subsequent drought. To reflect real-world responses to drought, future studies need to explicitly include plant\u2013microbial co-occurrence and potential co-adaptation and consider the precipitation history experienced by both plants and microbes.",

We implement a trait comparison to the potential optimum level suggested by two ecological reference groups of species to interpret these responses as filter driven convergence or divergence. The suggested set of metrics provided a clear ranking of traits and showed interpretational limitations of widely used short list of traits (e.g. seed weight, plant height and SLA). Results also demonstrate that there is no consistency between indicator metrics based on the shift in trait mean and those based on the reduction of variability, instead they provide complementary information. Unexpectedly, many characteristic traits of forest-specialist plants do not exhibit the expected responses. The response signal of many dispersal traits is too ambiguous to interpret because either (1) they do not have one clear optimum level, or (2) they indicate an establishment/persistence limitation instead, such as seed weight and flowering duration. Establishment traits indicate filtering clearly by improved light conditions. The pattern of trait means demonstrates that the dispersal filtering incrementally intensifies with distance, while establishment filtering occurs sharply at the forest-corridor ecotone. Consolidated results underscore that the migration of forest-restricted plants into corridors is limited by the habitat quality for dispersal vectors (e.g., for myrmecochores and zoochores), the scarcity of suitable microsites for seedling establishment, and the competition for light. A single optimal structure of wooded corridors cannot be suggested as forest-dwelling species exhibit various adaptations. Forest-biodiversity-enhancing wooded corridors should incorporate a diversity of shade levels and have structures that facilitate visits of forest insects, birds and mammals. We show that biased conclusions about the functional efficiency of habitats and limiting ecological filters can be avoided when indicator analytics include (1) multiple response metrics and analytical methods, (2) multiple seemingly redundant traits, and (3) several reference groups for interpretation. The proposed analytical approach adjusts for (1) the indictor choice subjectivity, and (2) the scaling bias implemented in several ecological indicator trait systems, which over-emphasise qualitative preferences of species rather than reflect their real niches.",

        "abstract": "Are savings evenly distributed and owned within families or do partners within families differ in their wealth? In this paper we investigated the ownership of financial assets within families and how joint savings affect the individual savings of the partners. We used anonymised monthly transactional data from ING Bank from 2014 to 2016 to observe financial data on Dutch couples. We found that savings were quite equally allocated in almost half of the households, while in the other half it was common that only one partner owned an individual account. The estimations showed that joint savings contributed to a more equal division of savings since they were held equally. However, we found larger differences in individual savings among partners who shared some savings, suggesting that the use of joint savings did not lead to individual savings being more evenly distributed, but rather to the opposite. The pattern was more apparent for households in their 20s and for savings accounts. The results of the study highlight the need for a better understanding of how partners make decisions about applying the sharing rule to joint and individual savings.",

To underline social capital's double\u2010edged aspects, this paper draws from the handful of studies that focus on individual social capital in crisis response, to systematize their findings according to bonding, bridging, and linking social capital and positive and negative impacts. In addition, the paper considers these findings to analyze the 2011 Ut\u00f8ya terrorist attack in Norway, to uncover new positive and negative effects of individual social capital, thus contributing to pushing the research agenda toward a more critical appraisal of individual social capital.",

Deuterium loading was performed by exposing the coatings to deuterium plasma in Magnum-PSI linear plasma device. The deuterium signals obtained by ex-situ LIBS had sufficiently good signal-to-noise ratio for reliable separation of essentially broadened hydrogen and deuterium lines as well as for comparison of the lateral and depth distributions of deuterium in the coatings. Strong deuterium signal was obtained for the first laser shot which corresponded to the surface layer of the W-O coatings whereas deeper in the coating the signal decreased to noise level. In addition, the deuterium signal was highest in the central region of compact W-O coating. For both coatings, depth profiles of elements obtained by LIBS match with those recorded by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) in the lateral direction along the sample surface. The results of LIBS and SIMS results were supported by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data which showed that the exposure to deuterium plasma resulted in remarkable changes in the surface morphology along the sample surface. The study demonstrates the LIBS potential in deuterium retention measurements in plasma facing components.",

The exposed samples were characterized by in situ ns-LIBS and complementary analysis methods Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy, Energy Dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and Nuclear Reaction Analysis. In agreement with the used complementary analysis methods, LIBS revealed the formation of up to 400 nm thick co-deposited surface layer in the central region of the coatings which contained a higher concentration of the main plasma impurities, such as N, and metals, such as Ta and Mo, the latter originating mainly from the substrate and from the plasma source. The deuterium retention on the other hand was highest outside from the central region of the coatings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is one of the most promising methods for quantitative in-situ determination of fuel retention in plasma-facing components (PFCs) of magnetically confined fusion devices like ITER and JET. In this article, the current state of understanding in LIBS development for fusion applications will be presented, based on a complete review of existing results and complemented with newly obtained data. The work has been performed as part of a research programme, set up in the EUROfusion Consortium, to address the main requirements for ITER: (a) quantification of fuel from relevant surfaces with high sensitivity, (b) the technical demonstration to perform LIBS with a remote handling system and (c) accurate detection of fuel at ambient pressures relevant for ITER. For the first goal, the elemental composition of ITER-like deposits and proxies to them, including deuterium (D) or helium (He) containing W\u2013Be, W, W\u2013Al and Be\u2013O\u2013C coatings, was successfully determined with a typical depth resolution ranging from 50 up to 250 nm per laser pulse. Deuterium was used as a substitute for tritium (T) and in the LIBS experiments deuterium surface densities below 10 16 D/cm 2 could be measured with an accuracy of \u223c30%, confirming the required high sensitivity for fuel-retention investigations. The performance of different LIBS configurations was explored, comprising LIBS systems based on single pulse (pulse durations: ps\u2013ns) and double pulse lasers with different pulse durations. For the second goal, a remote handling application was demonstrated inside the Frascati-Tokamak-Upgrade (FTU), where a compact, remotely controlled LIBS system was mounted on a multipurpose deployer providing an in-vessel retention monitor system. During a shutdown phase, LIBS was performed at atmospheric pressure, for measuring the composition and fuel content of different area of the stainless-steel FTU first wall, and the titanium zirconium molybdenum alloy tiles of the toroidal limiter. These achievements underline the capability of a LIBS-based retention monitor, which complies with the requirements for JET and ITER operating in DT with a beryllium wall and a tungsten divertor. Concerning the capabilities of LIBS at pressure conditions relevant for ITER, quantitative determination of the composition of PFC materials at ambient pressures up to 100 mbar of N 2 , the D content could be determined with an accuracy of 25%, while for atmospheric pressure conditions, an accuracy of about 50% was found when using single-pulse lasers. To improve the LIBS performance in atmospheric pressure conditions, a novel approach is proposed for quantitative determination of the retained T and the D/T ratio. This scenario is based on measuring the LIBS plume emission at two different time delays after each laser pulse. On virtue of application of a double pulse LIBS system, for LIBS application at N 2 atmospheric pressure the distinguishability of the spectra from H isotopes could be significantly improved, but further systematic research is required.",

        "abstract": "Characterizing genetic influences on DNA methylation (DNAm) provides an opportunity to understand mechanisms underpinning gene regulation and disease. In the present study, we describe results of DNAm quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analyses on 32,851 participants, identifying genetic variants associated with DNAm at 420,509 DNAm sites in blood. We present a database of >270,000 independent mQTLs, of which 8.5% comprise long-range (trans) associations. Identified mQTL associations explain 15\u201317% of the additive genetic variance of DNAm. We show that the genetic architecture of DNAm levels is highly polygenic. Using shared genetic control between distal DNAm sites, we constructed networks, identifying 405 discrete genomic communities enriched for genomic annotations and complex traits. Shared genetic variants are associated with both DNAm levels and complex diseases, but only in a minority of cases do these associations reflect causal relationships from DNAm to trait or vice versa, indicating a more complex genotype\u2013phenotype map than previously anticipated. DNA methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analyses on 32,851 participants identify genetic variants associated with DNA methylation at 420,509 sites in blood, resulting in a database of >270,000 independent mQTLs.",

        "abstract": "Total suspended solids (TSS) concentration is an important biogeochemical parameter for water quality management and sediment-transport studies. In this study, we propose a novel semi-analytical method for estimating TSS in clear to extremely turbid waters from remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs). The proposed method includes three sub-algorithms used sequentially. First, the remotely sensed waters are classified into clear (Type I), moderately turbid (Type II), highly turbid (Type III), and extremely turbid (Type IV) water types by comparing the values of Rrs at 490, 560, 620, and 754 nm. Second, semi-analytical models specific to each water type are used to determine the particulate backscattering coefficients (bbp) at a corresponding single wavelength (i.e., 560 nm for Type I, 665 nm for Type II, 754 nm for Type III, and 865 nm for Type IV). Third, a specific relationship between TSS and bbp at the corresponding wavelength is used in each water type. Unlike other existing approaches, this method is strictly semi-analytical and its sub-algorithms were developed using synthetic datasets only. The performance of the proposed method was compared to that of three other state-of-the-art methods using simulated (N = 1000, TSS ranging from 0.01 to 1100 g/m3) and in situ measured (N = 3421, TSS ranging from 0.09 to 2627 g/m3) pairs of Rrs and TSS. Results showed a significant improvement with a Median Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 16.0% versus 30.2\u201390.3% for simulated data and 39.7% versus 45.9\u201358.1% for in situ data, respectively. The new method was subsequently applied to 175 MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and 498 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) images acquired in the 2003\u20132020 timeframe to produce long-term TSS time-series for Lake Suwa and Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. Performance assessments using MERIS and OLCI matchups showed good agreements with in situ TSS measurements.",

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, a discussion about the limits of peer production has opened. On the one hand, some scholars consider peer production as a new path of value creation that could lead to an alternative form of social organization. On the other, critics claim that peer production is not emancipatory, but in fact suffers from rigid hierarchies, participation inequality, power asymmetries, and gender imbalance. Moreover, they argue that peer production depends on the capitalist economy for its reproduction and thus that its post-capitalist potential is very limited. This article summarizes and reviews the criticism against the emancipatory potential of peer production and proposes ways in which peer production could still democratize technology and society.",

        "abstract": "An emerging commons-oriented mode of production that combines globally accessible knowledge with distributed manufacturing has recently been presented as a better fit for sustainable degrowth and localisation, compared to incumbent practices. To tentatively test this potential we select the case of 3D printers. The production of 3D printers varies within a spectrum from proprietary and industrially produced to open-source and locally manufactured. We compare different 3D printers within this spectrum, adopting a values-based life cycle analysis tool that allows for a critical evaluation of the sustainability of 3D printers from a degrowth perspective. An emphasis on the prospects for sustainable localisation is given at each life cycle stage. We find significant advantages of open-source 3D printers in terms of education, experimentation and maintenance, and enhanced conviviality in case parts of their manufacturing is localised. Still, to a large extent their manufacturing process remains a highly centralised process, hindering additional benefits, and coherence with sustainable degrowth and localisation. We conclude with insights on how openness in terms of materials production and proper documentation of the manufacturing process, as well as a multi-level organisation for local production could lead to more sustainable practices.",

        "abstract": "This article focusses on the concept of decision and its significance for identity politics. Constructivist scholarship established long ago that identity and foreign policy are mutually constitutive and that difference and othering are key for the production of identities. As a consequence, constructivist literature on EU foreign policy has focussed on the role of specific others and explored how interaction with them shapes the EU\u2019s identity. Our article turns the attention back inside and looks at the hegemonic struggles around the purpose and meaning of the European project. By analyzing the EU\u2019s reaction to the Libyan events in 2011, we demonstrate how a major international crisis dislocates the identities involved and unleashes a struggle for hegemony between conflicting discursive articulations. Eventually this conflict is resolved through a political decision, which reconfigures the entire \u2018global\u2019 outlook on Europe and its role in the world. By defining decision along poststructuralist lines, as distinct from the conventional literature on decision-making, we demonstrate that the use of this conceptual prism helps deepen our understanding of how othering and bordering work to produce and reshape identities. By doing that, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of how identities change in time.",

        "abstract": "Solvent-free, atom-efficient, and mechanochemically activated reactions have emerged as synthetic strategy for sustainable chemistry. Herein we report a new mechanochemical approach for the amide coupling of carboxylic acids and amines, mediated by combination of (1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethylidenaminooxy)dimethylaminomorpholinocarbenium hexafluorophosphate (COMU) or N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylchloroformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (TCFH) and K2HPO4. The method delivers a range of amides in high yields (70\u201396%) and fast reaction rates. The reaction protocol is mild, keeps stereochemical integrity of the adjacent to carbonyl stereocenters, and streamlines isolation procedure for solid amide products. Minimal waste is generated due to the absence of bulk solvent. We show that K2HPO4 plays a dual role, acting as a base and a precursor of reactive acyl phosphate species. Amide bonds from hindered carboxylic acids and low-nucleophilic amines can be assembled within 90 minutes by using TCFH in combination with K2HPO4 or N-methylimidazole. The developed mechanochemical liquid-assisted amidation protocols were successfully applied to the challenging couplings of all six carboxylate functions of biotin[6]uril macrocycle with phenylalanine methyl ester, resulting in 80% yield of highly pure hexa-amide-biotin[6]uril. In addition, fast and high-yielding synthesis of peptides and versatile amide compounds can be performed in a safe and environmentally benign manner, as verified by green metrics.",

The following research questions are addressed: How have recently established e-participation initiatives been institutionalized in public administrations? What are the formal and informal aspects of their institutionalization? It is concluded that the adoption of a digital solution does not in itself trigger a change in the policy-making process because the institutionalization of e-participation is not a linear process. The formal institutionalization increases the sustainability, transparency, and throughput legitimacy of e-participation and allows citizen proposals to be handled in a standardized way. Although the formal institutionalization of e-participation is key for an institutional change towards deliberative democracy, it needs to be accompanied by informal institutionalization through the supporting ideas, values, and preferences of politicians and public officials who have the power to change public institutions.",

Exploiting cross-sectional firm-level data from the fifth round of the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, the paper argues that institutional context has utmost importance when approaching this link. Probit estimations for a full sample of former Soviet Union countries indicate a positive link between bribes and firm innovation. Considering variations in institutional development levels, the paper distinguishes three clusters of countries within the region with respect to the quality of institutional structures based on Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) data from the World Bank. The results reveal that the grease-the-wheel effect of bribery on firm innovation strongly remains in countries with weak institutional quality. To explore this link further, this paper made several additional estimations and robustness checks.",

        "abstract": "Although they are instrumental for economic development, productivity-enhancing corporate investments may increase the financial vulnerability of companies, especially in an economic and financial crisis. We employ an instrumental probit model with the aim of finding evidence for the investment and credit patterns that led companies into financial distress during the global financial crisis 2009\u20132010. The company-level micro-data for our study on three Central and East European countries\u2014Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and two Baltic countries, Latvia and Lithuania\u2014originates from two independent surveys, the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey conducted in 2008 and the Financial Crisis Survey conducted in 2009/2010. Both were carried out jointly by the EBRD and the World Bank. Our results emphasize a substantial adverse impact from investment intensity and debt financing on company financial soundness during a crisis. On top of that, we discover a strong non-linear pattern in the sensitivity of company distress to its investment-financing nexus.",

This article presents fully observed recursive structural equation estimates, based on data from the authors\u2019 original repeated survey of Estonian creative R&D employees on a sample of 153 individuals from eleven entities. It finds that opting for flexible working time is strongly driven by gender\u2014males are more likely than females to opt for R&D jobs with flexible schedules. R&D employees who mainly work remotely are more satisfied with their work results. Noncreative work tasks reduce R&D employees\u2019 contentment with their work outcomes and lower\u2014at least in their own perception\u2014the productiveness of their work in terms of creating value or new knowledge. Employees of both evening and morning types are found to have much more satisfaction with their work results than employees with no distinct morning-evening profile. These findings stress the benefits of flexible work arrangements in creative R&D jobs in order to account for individual differences and stimulate R&D output.",

        "abstract": "Splitting of large procurements into several smaller ones has been propagated, for example in the European Union and OECD members, as a way for enhancing competition and improving institutional framework for market efficiency. This paper presents a conceptual argumentation on the causes and consequences of potential bid rigging when simultaneous bids for similar goods are asked from oligopolists. It appears that calling for similar bids simultaneously may incentivise collusion among bidders, while arranging several consecutive procurement auctions could lessen that problem. Moreover, simultaneous procurement auctions may result in a relatively high cost of supply due to the larger risks involved for bidders. Furthermore, bid rigging remains difficult to detect under simultaneous procurement auctions due to a large degree of uncertainty for bidders, which supports relatively high bid prices that may, in fact, be collusive.",

The paper uses multivariate ordered probit modelling on data from an original repeated survey of Estonian creative R&D employees. The results indicate that high creative intensity of work is a strong predictor of an R&D employee being satisfied with flexible rather than fixed working schedules. Women and employees with less creative and more administrative tasks perceive more constraints on the timing of their work due to jealousy of colleagues and they are more likely to feel that their creativity is adversely affected by their working time arrangements. Employees with flexibility in both the timing and place of doing their work are significantly less likely to perceive working time\u2013related constraints on their creativity or jealousy of their colleagues as a restraint on their working time choices than are those with a fixed working time and place. The higher the salary level of the employee, the more likely they are to feel that the nature of their work constrains their working time choices. The study helps in understanding and alleviating restrictions on time-wise job autonomy that may have considerable adverse effects on how efficiently the intellectual capital of R&D employees is used.",

        "abstract": "Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology to automate routine work such as copying data across applications or filling in document templates using data from multiple applications. RPA tools allow organizations to automate a wide range of routines. However, identifying and scoping routines that can be automated using RPA tools is time consuming. Manual identification of candidate routines via interviews, walk-throughs, or job shadowing allow analysts to identify the most visible routines, but these methods are not suitable when it comes to identifying the long tail of routines in an organization. This article proposes an approach to discover automatable routines from logs of user interactions with IT systems and to synthetize executable specifications for such routines. The proposed approach focuses on discovering routines where a user transfers data from a set of fields (or cells) in an application, to another set of fields in the same or in a different application (data transfer routines). The approach starts by discovering frequent routines at a control-flow level (candidate routines). It then determines which of these candidate routines are automatable and it synthetizes an executable specification for each such routine. Finally, it identifies semantically equivalent routines so as to output a set of non-redundant routines. The article reports on an evaluation of the approach using a combination of synthetic and real-life logs. The evaluation results show that the approach can discover automatable routines that are known to be present in a UI log, and that it discovers routines that users recognize as such in real-life logs. \u2022 This paper presents an approach to discover executable specifications for RPA. \u2022 The approach takes as input a log of User Interactions from one or more process workers. \u2022 The approach produces an executable specification that can be compiled into an RPA bot. \u2022 The approach is evaluated on synthetic and real-life logs. \u2022 The evaluation reports on its execution times and ability to accurately discover routines. \u2022 The evaluation shows that the approach is able to rediscover routines present in a log. \u2022 The approach identifies automatable routines that users recognize as such in real-life logs.",

        "abstract": "The applicability of process mining techniques hinges on the availability of event logs capturing the execution of a business process. In some use cases, particularly those involving customer-facing processes, these event logs may contain private information. Data protection regulations restrict the use of such event logs for analysis purposes. One way of circumventing these restrictions is to anonymize the event log to the extent that no individual can be singled out using the anonymized log. This article addresses the problem of anonymizing an event log in order to guarantee that, upon release of the anonymized log, the probability that an attacker may single out any individual represented in the original log does not increase by more than a threshold. The article proposes a differentially private release mechanism, which samples the cases in the log and adds noise to the timestamps to the extent required to achieve the above privacy guarantee. The article reports on an empirical comparison of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art approaches using 14 real-life event logs in terms of data utility loss and computational efficiency.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has involved the input of various kinds of heterogeneous data in real time and from multiple sources, which presents several additional challenges. Studies on Data Fusion (DF) have delivered significant enhancements in ITS and demonstrated a substantial impact on its evolution. This paper introduces a systematic literature review on recent data fusion methods and extracts the main issues and challenges of using these techniques in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). It endeavors to identify and discuss the multi-sensor data sources and properties used for various traffic domains, including autonomous vehicles, detection models, driving assistance, traffic prediction, Vehicular communication, Localization, and management systems. Moreover, it attempts to associate abstractions of observation-level fusion, feature-level fusion, and decision-level fusion with different methods to better understand how DF is used in ITS applications. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to review DF methods used for ITS studies to extract its trendy challenges. The review outcomes are (i) a description of the current Data fusion methods that adopt multi-sensor sources of heterogeneous data under different evaluation strategies, (ii) identifying several research gaps, current challenges, and new research trends.",

Staphylococcus aureus is known to be associated with increased mRNA levels of IL1 family cytokines in the skin and more severe AD. In this study, the altered expression of IL-1 family cytokines and inflammasome-related genes was confirmed, and a positive relationship between mRNA levels of inflammasome sensor NLRP1 and IL1B or IL18 was determined. Enhanced expression of the NLRP1 and PYCARD proteins and increased caspase-1 activity were detected in the skin of patients with AD. The genetic association of IL18R1 and IL18RAP with AD was confirmed, and the involvement of various immune cell types was predicted using published GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci datasets. In keratinocytes, the inoculation with S. aureus led to the increased secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, whereas small interfering RNA silencing of NLRP1 inhibited the production of these cytokines. Our results suggest that skin colonization with S. aureus may cause the activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome in keratinocytes, which leads to the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and thereby may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, particularly in the presence of genetic variations in the IL-18 pathway.
