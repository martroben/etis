Some publication 1c2c5e88-e433-4aa1-b7d1-14d25d48850d:
Not visible in project API response: https://www.etis.ee:7443/api/project/getitems?Format=json&Take=1&Guid=b1fac2a5-d883-48ed-b95e-1ab1b3381a89
Visible in project display page: https://www.etis.ee/Portal/Projects/Display/b1fac2a5-d883-48ed-b95e-1ab1b3381a89
Has UUID 3380759f-3947-4fe3-ba2b-63536ce9a737 in project page - seems to be the same ETIS API problem that I reported before.

In ETIS project info, it seems that the roof project total funding is total funding for all organizations participating in the project. The funding period total is the funding to the Estonian organization.
